This project uses a locally-executable REST API : OCMovies-API <br>
Please refer to explanations on https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR for its use.

Once API server is installed and launched, you can open the `index.html` on your browser.
The `index.html` file calls the two files `style.css` and `myscript.js` for visual settings and dynamic modifications.

Default settings of the js script are :
  - 7 images per category
  - horror, animation and western for the three categories
  
It's possible to select another number of images in the caroussel by modification of `nbCatxMovies` value.
Other genres are possible by replacing strings in `cat1`, `cat2` or `cat3` variables.
